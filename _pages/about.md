Hi, I'm Tianyu. I am a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College. I have the great honor of being advised by [Prof. Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/).

I am passionate about model diagnostics and mechanistic interpretability . My  current research is focused on

- understanding the mechanisms, dynamics and generalization of LLMs  from the perspective of random matrix theory, high-dimensional statistics and loss landscape;
- leveraging  model/data diagnostics and interpretability insights to improve the transparency, robustness and efficiency  of (scientific) machine learning.
